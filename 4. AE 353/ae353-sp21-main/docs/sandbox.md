## AE 353 (Spring 2021)

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/tbretl/ae353-sp21/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Math Examples

Here is an example of inline math, we know $a + b = c$ is true.

Here is an example of display math:
$$a + b = c$$

Here is another example of display math:
\\[a + b = c\\]

Here is yet another example of display math:
\begin{equation}
a + b = c
\end{equation}

Here is even yet another example of display math:
\begin{align}
a + b = c \\\\
d + e = f
\end{align}

$$
\begin{align}
a + b = c \\\\
d + e = f
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
a + b &= c \\
d + e &= f \\
g + h &= i + j
\end{align}
$$

Escape example: \$

Here is still yet another example of display math, which does not work:
\begin{align*}
a + b = c
\end{align*}

What about code blocks with latex?
```
$$
\begin{align}
a + b &= c \\
d + e &= f \\
g + h &= i + j
\end{align}
$$
```
